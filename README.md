=======

simple rails app to allow irc like chat

goals
-----

1. testing with multiple capybara sessions
2. use redis-objects

notes
-----

pub/sub with websockets is a much better idea than this but unfortunately
capybara to the best of my knowledge doesn't support them.

TODO
----

get ajax reload working
